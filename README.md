- A computer with internet access

## Installation

1. Boot your computer using the Arch Linux installation medium.
2. Connect to the internet.
3. Recover archinstall configuration::

```bash
# Download fileconfig.json
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ludofr3/Arch_Configuration/main/archinstall_config/fileconfig.json
```

```bash
# Download fileconfigcredential.json
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ludofr3/Arch_Configuration/main/archinstall_config/fileconfigcredential.json
```
4. Customize the `fileconfig.json` and `fileconfigcredential.json` files according to your preferences.

5. Launch archinstall:

```bash
archinstall --config fileconfig.json --creds fileconfigcredential.json
